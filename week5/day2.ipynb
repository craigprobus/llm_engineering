The generic SObject type isn’t supported. For example, you can define a list of events as:\\nList<Order_Event__e> events = new List<Order_Event__e>();\\nBut not as:\\nList<SObject> events = new List<SObject>();\\nThen you can publish the events with a callback.\\nevents.add(new Order_Event__e());\\nEventBus.publish(events, myCallback);\\nKeep the Event UUID Map Size Small for Improved Performance\\nTo reduce the callback instance size, keep the map of event UUIDs small in the callback. A small callback instance size ensures better\\nperformance and helps avoid hitting the cumulative usage limit of all publish callbacks. Map the event UUID to a record ID that you can\\nquery to populate the remaining event fields. Alternatively, if you want to save the entire event as the map value, make sure that the\\nevent doesn’t have too many fields and the field sizes are small.

The\\nonly dependency between producers and consumers is the semantic of the message content.\\nThe Event Bus\\nPlatform event messages are published to the event bus, where they’re stored temporarily. You can retrieve stored event messages from\\nthe event bus using Pub/Sub API . Each event message contains the Replay ID field, which identifies the event in the stream and enables\\nreplaying the stream after a specific event. For more information, see Event Message Durability in the Pub/Sub API Developer Guide.\\nEnterprise Messaging Platform Events\\nThe Salesforce enterprise messaging platform offers the benefits of event-driven software architectures. Platform events are the event\\nmessages (or notifications) that your apps send and receive to take further action. Platform events simplify the process of communicating\\nchanges and responding to them without writing complex logic. Publishers and subscribers communicate with each other through\\nevents. One or more subscribers can listen to the same event and carry out actions.\\nFor example, a software system can send events containing information about printer ink cartridges. Subscribers can subscribe to the\\nevents to monitor printer ink levels and place orders to replace cartridges with low ink levels.\\nCustom Platform Events\\nUse custom platform events to publish and process custom notifications. For example, publish custom platform events to send order\\ninformation to an order fulfillment service. Or publish custom platform events to send printer ink information that is processed by a\\nservice app.\\n3\\nEnterprise Messaging Platform EventsPlatform Events Developer Guide')"
