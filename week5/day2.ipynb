The generic SObject type isn’t supported. For example, you can define a list of events as:\\nList<Order_Event__e> events = new List<Order_Event__e>();\\nBut not as:\\nList<SObject> events = new List<SObject>();\\nThen you can publish the events with a callback.\\nevents.add(new Order_Event__e());\\nEventBus.publish(events, myCallback);\\nKeep the Event UUID Map Size Small for Improved Performance\\nTo reduce the callback instance size, keep the map of event UUIDs small in the callback. A small callback instance size ensures better\\nperformance and helps avoid hitting the cumulative usage limit of all publish callbacks. Map the event UUID to a record ID that you can\\nquery to populate the remaining event fields. Alternatively, if you want to save the entire event as the map value, make sure that the\\nevent doesn’t have too many fields and the field sizes are small.

You can retrieve stored event messages from\\nthe event bus using Pub/Sub API . Each event message contains the Replay ID field, which identifies the event in the stream and enables\\nreplaying the stream after a specific event. For more information, see Event Message Durability in the Pub/Sub API Developer Guide.\\nEnterprise Messaging Platform Events\\nThe Salesforce enterprise messaging platform offers the benefits of event-driven software architectures. Platform events are the event\\nmessages (or notifications) that your apps send and receive to take further action. Platform events simplify the process of communicating\\nchanges and responding to them without writing complex logic. Publishers and subscribers communicate with each other through\\nevents. One or more subscribers can listen to the same event and carry out actions.\\nFor example, a software system can send events containing information about printer ink cartridges. Subscribers can subscribe to the\\nevents to monitor printer ink levels and place orders to replace cartridges with low ink levels.\\nCustom Platform Events\\nUse custom platform events to publish and process custom notifications. For example, publish custom platform events to send order\\ninformation to an order fulfillment service. Or publish custom platform events to send printer ink information that is processed by a\\nservice app.\\n3\\nEnterprise Messaging Platform EventsPlatform Events Developer Guide')"

      "that’s compatible with Salesforce’s BYOK service. Also review several important terms relevant to the Cache-Only Key Service\n",
      "Prerequisites\n",
      "• The Cache-Only Key Service is available for tenant secrets only. It isn’t compatible with root keys, such as those used with Search\n",
      "Index Encryption.\n",
      "• Prepare your Salesforce org. Make sure that your org has at least one active Data in Salesforce key, either Salesforce-generated or\n",
      "one that you supply. You can create a tenant secret by clicking Generate Tenant Secret on the Key Management page in Setup.\n",
      "• Generate and host key material. The cache-only key exchange protocol and format requires that keys are wrapped in an opinionated\n",
      "JSON Web Encryption (JWE). This format uses RSAES-OAEP for key encryption and AES GCM for content encryption.\n",
      "• Use a secure, trusted service to generate, store, and back up your key material.\n",
      "• Use and maintain a reliable high-availability key service. To mitigate any potential impact to business continuity, choose a\n",
      "high-availability key service with an acceptable service level agreement (SLA), predefined maintenance procedures, and processes.\n",
      "• When the connection between Salesforce and your key service is broken, the Cache-Only Key Service can encrypt and decrypt data\n",
      "as long as your key material is in the cache. However, keys don’t stay in the cache for long. The cache is regularly flushed every 72\n",
      "hours, but some Salesforce operations flush the cache about every 24 hours.\n",
      "• If your key material isn’t in the cache and the connection to your key service is broken, users can’t encrypt or decrypt records. Make\n",
      "sure that you use a key service that Salesforce can connect to at any time, especially during busy times, such as the end of the year\n",
      "or quarter.\n",
      "• Maintain a secure callout endpoint. The cache-only key exchange protocol requires that keys are wrapped in an opinionated JSON\n",
      "format. Host your wrapped key inside the key response at a location Salesforce can request.\n",
      "• The Cache-Only Key Service uses named credentials to establish a secure, authenticated connection to allowed IP addresses and\n",
      "domains. You can configure your named credentials to use popular authentication formats, such as Mutual TLS and OAuth. You can\n",
      "change these authentication protocols at any time.\n",
      "Note:  A named credential for cache-only keys must specify a named principal. Creating a cache-only keys named credential\n",
      "requires the basic Named Credentials process with the added step of adding the autoproc user to a permission set. See\n",
      "Use a Named Principal-Based Credential for a Cache-Only Key for full details.\n",
      "• Actively monitor your key service logs for errors. While Salesforce is here to help you with the Shield Platform Encryption service,\n",
      "you’re responsible for maintaining the high-availability key service that you use to host your key material. You can use the\n",
      "RemoteKeyCalloutEvent object to review or track cache-only key events.\n",
      "Warning:  Because you’re in control of your keys, you’re responsible for securing and backing up your key material. Salesforce\n",
      "can’t retrieve lost key material stored outside of our encrypted key cache.\n",

      "• Generate and host key material. The cache-only key exchange protocol and format requires that keys are wrapped in an opinionated\n",
